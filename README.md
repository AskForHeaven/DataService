# DataService
DataService is an intuitive and simplistic data saving and loading module that handles absent values and session locking for you. DataService makes only one call to Roblox's DataStoreService in it's entire code, making it relatively lightweight and efficient - feel free to change your data set at any time without needing to worry about clogging up your DataStore queue.
